This addon makes it possible to add custom roles to [Garry's Mod Among Us](https://github.com/NotMyWing/GarrysModAmongUs), inspired by [TTT2](https://github.com/TTT-2/TTT2).

A documentation on how to create roles can be found [here]().

This is still a beta version so expect bugs and let me know [here](https://github.com/Blaubeeree/au-moreroles/issues) if you find some.
